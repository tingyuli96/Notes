```
Scanner 
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
```
read next string
`String myString = scanner.next();`

read next line
`String myString = scanner.nextLine();`

read next int
`int i = scanner.nextInt();`

detect end of file
`scan.hasNext()`

**Notes**
after read int, scanner won't take the `\n` string, so `scanner.nextLine()` `scanner.next()` will read this character
