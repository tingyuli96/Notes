### Can we construct the binary tree give two tranversal sequence
If one of the tranversal is in-order, then the tree can be construct, otherwise not.

If given post-order and pre-order, the tree can be construct only when the tree is full.
#### why


The key to get a unique traverse of a tree is to distinct the left and right children.
