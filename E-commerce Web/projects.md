#### Nginx - Reverse proxy
- install
`brew install nginx`
```
The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx
  ```
