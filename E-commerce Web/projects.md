#### Nginx - Reverse proxy
- install
`brew install nginx`
```
The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx
  ```
  
- Overview
In [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), a **reverse proxy** is a type of [proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server") that retrieves resources on behalf of a [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)") from one or more [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"). These resources are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy#cite_note-apache-forward-reverse-1) Unlike a [forward proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_proxy "Forward proxy"), which is an intermediary for its associated clients to contact any server, a reverse proxy is an intermediary for its associated servers to be contacted by any client. In other words, a _proxy_ acts on behalf of the client(s), while a _reverse proxy_ acts on behalf of the server(s).
